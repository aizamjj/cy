# Nodes

`cy` currently supports the following layout node types:

- **[Bar](/layouts/nodes/bar.md)**: A node that adds a customizable status bar to the top or bottom of a node.
- **[Borders](/layouts/nodes/borders.md)**: A node is enclosed in borders with an optional title on the top or bottom.
- **[Color map](/layouts/nodes/color-map.md)**: A node that applies a [color map](/parameters/colors.md#color-maps) to its contents.
- **[Margins](/layouts/nodes/margins.md)**: A margins mode constrains the size of its child node by adding transparent margins.
- **[Pane](/layouts/nodes/pane.md)**: A pane node can be attached to panes that exist in [the node tree](/groups-and-panes.md).
- **[Split](/layouts/nodes/split.md)**: A split node divides the screen space of its parent node in two and provides it to two other nodes, drawing a line on the screen between them.
- **[Tabs](/layouts/nodes/tabs.md)**: A node that can display different pages of content navigable using a familiar tab bar.

The following sections go into these types in more detail.
